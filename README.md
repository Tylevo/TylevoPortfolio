As of right now most of my dropdowns are broken and my code is messy. A lot of the stuff in the navbar is not usuable right now. My navbar has given me a lot of struggles as well. Ive tried centering the information countless times and can never seem to get it to work. Mobile porting is a complete mess but it has kinda the desired look as i dont want it to look the same as it does on the desktop variant.
